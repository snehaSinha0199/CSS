		challenging time for all of us and we have a lot of information coming

		and worried and scared sometimes.According to WHO(World Health
		Organisation) Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will
		experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
		requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying
		medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
		respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
		illness.</p>

	<p>According to the Survey of India most people who are suffering
		from Covid 19 virus also loose their confidence of recovering due to
		increasing rate of deaths.We should not get panic because of this
		virus because india is also improving a lot as like other
		countries.The disease causes no symptoms or is mild in 81% of cases.
		Of course, in the remaining 14%, it can cause severe pneumonia and in
		5% it can become critical or even fatal. It is still unclear what the
		death rate may be. Be it could be lower than some estimates so far.</p>
